    "Variables are symbols that you can use to store data in a program. You can think of them as an empty box that you fill with some data or value. Strings are data, so we can use them to fill up a variable. Declaring strings as variables can make it easier for us to work with strings throughout our Python programs.string are written in Inverted commas\n"

    "A statement is a complete line of code that performs an action or a series of actions. For example, spam = 10 is a statement that assigns the value 10 to the variable spam.The key difference between an expression and a statement is that an expression always produces a value, whereas a statement may or may not produce a value. In the example above, the statement spam = 10 doesn't produce a value, but it does have the side effect of assigning the value 10 to the variable spam"
